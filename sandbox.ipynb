    "To evaluate the accuracy of a pregnancy test facility in a case study involving 1,000 women, we need to follow a systematic approach to test and analyze the results. Below, I outline a comprehensive plan that includes study details, methodology, metrics for evaluation, and examples of analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Study Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Total Participants:** 1,000 women \n",
    "  - **Group A (Pregnant):** 500 women (definitely pregnant)\n",
    "  - **Group B (Not Pregnant):** 500 women (definitely not pregnant)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Objective**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objective is to test the accuracy of the pregnancy test facility by calculating its performance metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and overall accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Test Implementation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each woman will undergo a pregnancy test at the facility, which will classify each result as either:\n",
    "- **Positive:** Indicates that the test suggests the woman is pregnant.\n",
    "- **Negative:** Indicates that the test suggests the woman is not pregnant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Defining Outcomes**\n",
    "\n",
    "After testing, results will be classified into four categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **True Positive (TP):** Pregnant women who test positive.\n",
    "- **False Positive (FP):** Non-pregnant women who test positive.\n",
    "- **True Negative (TN):** Non-pregnant women who test negative.\n",
    "- **False Negative (FN):** Pregnant women who test negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Hypothetical Test Results**\n",
    "\n",
    "For analysis, let's consider the following hypothetical results from the tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **True Positives (TP):** 480 pregnant women test positive.\n",
    "- **False Negatives (FN):** 20 pregnant women test negative.\n",
    "- **True Negatives (TN):** 490 non-pregnant women test negative.\n",
    "- **False Positives (FP):** 10 non-pregnant women test positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Calculation of Metrics**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the results above, we can calculate the following performance metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sensitivity (True Positive Rate):**\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\text{Sensitivity} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN} = \\frac{480}{480 + 20} = \\frac{480}{500} = 0.96 \\, (96\\%)\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Specificity (True Negative Rate):**\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\text{Specificity} = \\frac{TN}{TN + FP} = \\frac{490}{490 + 10} = \\frac{490}{500} = 0.98 \\, (98\\%)\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Positive Predictive Value (PPV):**\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\text{PPV} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP} = \\frac{480}{480 + 10} = \\frac{480}{490} \\approx 0.9796 \\, (97.96\\%)\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Negative Predictive Value (NPV):**\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\text{NPV} = \\frac{TN}{TN + FN} = \\frac{490}{490 + 20} = \\frac{490}{510} \\approx 0.9608 \\, (96.08\\%)\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overall Accuracy:**\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\text{Accuracy} = \\frac{TP + TN}{TP + FP + TN + FN} = \\frac{480 + 490}{500 + 500} = \\frac{970}{1000} = 0.97 \\, (97\\%)\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Results Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the hypothetical results, the pregnancy test facility demonstrates:\n",
    "- **Sensitivity:** 96% (high ability to correctly identify pregnant women).\n",
    "- **Specificity:** 98% (high ability to correctly identify non-pregnant women).\n",
    "- **Positive Predictive Value (PPV):** ~98% (likelihood that a positive test result indicates pregnancy).\n",
    "- **Negative Predictive Value (NPV):** ~96% (likelihood that a negative test result indicates no pregnancy).\n",
    "- **Overall Accuracy:** 97% (overall correctness of the test results).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Conclusion and Recommendations**\n",
    "\n",
    "The pregnancy test facility shows high accuracy in identifying both pregnant and non-pregnant women based on the hypothetical data provided. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendations:**\n",
    "- These results suggest the tests are reliable, but continuous quality control is advised.\n",
    "- Investigating causes for any false positives or negatives can help improve accuracy.\n",
    "- It might be beneficial to repeat the study with a larger and more diverse sample to validate findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "This framework provides a clear structure for analyzing and interpreting the accuracy of a pregnancy test facility in a controlled case study.\n"
